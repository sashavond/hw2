        <h1>TURTLE TIME IS NOW</h1>
        <h3>SMALL WAYS WE CAN BE BETTER</h3>
        <h2>HOMEPAGE<h2>
        <p class="quoted">Here at Turtle Time (is) Now we firmly believe
                that the human race can no longer in good conscience treat
                turtles the way that we have. Haven't you seen that video
                where the turtle had the plastic straw stuck in its nostril?
                That was absolutely brutal, and it has to stop.</p>
        <p>
                That's why we at TTN have developed a new brand of paper
                straw that doesn't dissolve in your coffee after 0.7 seconds!
